#CSC-280: Introduction to Computer Science I

## Overview
This repository is an archive of previous work conducted as part of American University's introductory level computer science course. Most - if not all - of the project code contained here is representative of my own original thinking with regards to the computer science problems posed by my professor. I may revisit or revise this code in the future.

## File Structure
Files are sorted by project.

Each project typically includes:

1. A project file, written for the assignment
2. A tester file, to test the validity of the former

Project files follow a naming convention adopted from early in-class examples, being named "Project" followed by a spelled-out number designation:

    ProjectNumber.py
    
Similarly, tester files are named "testProject" followed by the relevant number:

	testProjectNumber.py
	
Some projects do not include a tester. This is due either to the difficulty in building a program that tests project functions, or the lack of a working, pre-compiled "key" copy of the project to test the student copy against.

## Language
All projects were written in Python, in adherence to the 2.7 language standard.
